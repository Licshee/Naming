# ID & OK

Altough they are abbr. for identity/identifier & okay, we usually write them as "ID" & "OK".

It's possible that we actually recognize them as symbols.

This means when we encounter one of these two abbr., we recognize it as ONE character, instead of being TWO letters.

Therefore I suggest to think in a way like they are indead ONE character,

when you spell them, you always write the two letters both uppercase or both lowercase,

never write in a way where one letter is uppercase and the other is lowercase.

# Log or Sign, In/Out or On/Off

Actually, there is no key difference between those combines,
you can use whichever you want and neither is wrong.

But when using "Log" as the left part, it is well accepted that the whole term can be recognized as a compound word,

this means:

DOs|NOT
---|---
Login, logon|logIn, LogOn
logout, Logoff|LogOut, logOff

Furthermore, Login & Logon are often used as equivaluents or alternates terms to Account, Identity or other similair terms.

So "Sign" is usually prefered for other uses,

and to reduce confusions, In/Out are always prefered before On/Off.
