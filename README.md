# ID & OK

Altough they are abbr. for identity/identifier & okay, we usually write them as "ID" & "OK".

It's possible that we actually recognize them as symbols.

This means when we encounter one of these two abbr., we recognize it as ONE character, instead of being TWO letters.

Therefore I suggest to think in a way like they are indead ONE character,

when you spell them, you always write the two letters both uppercase or both lowercase,

never write in a way where one letter is uppercase and the other is lowercase.
